public class Fibonacci {
	//todo: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the current number is the sum of the previous numbers. You can read it up here:
	//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
	//Write an iterative method fib which takes an integer as parameter. This integer corresponds to the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
	//fib should return the fibonacci number at this position. For example, fib(4) should return 3.
	//Now, write a second methond fibRek. fibRek does exactly the same like fib, but it works recursive.
